# BART_map
An application that will show you, in real-time, BART trains that are stationed (via BART map).

Currently, users can view departing trains on the map (indicated with a black point over a station). Leaving trains may linger on the station for about a minute before it disappears.

Currently, there are no movements of points between stations, due to the points being plotted using ```matplotlib```. In the future, it would be nice to track train movement along the BART lines; however, I believe another method of plotting should be employed other than a scatterplot overlay on a BART map.
